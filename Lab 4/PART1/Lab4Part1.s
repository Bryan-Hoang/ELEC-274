# HISTORY:
# 170114 DFA	First release, based on code found in Altera documentation
#				and on several websites.  Intended for QECE ELEC274.
# 170222 DFA	Added echo to read character routine.
# 180207 DFA	Minor code cleanup; removed redundant code

# Uses:

# Returns:

# Subroutine PrintString
# Print ASCIZ string to output device.  This code uses the PrintChar function
# so it needs to save ra.  Note that this code will keep outputting characters
# until NUL found - it does not have any length checking.

# Parameters:

# Return value:
#	R4	- point to end of string (i.e. null character at end.
